## Training Plan Testimonials

_"Safe to say I nailed it... Entirely down to following the training you set out. I can't thank you enough, I would never have reached my best without your help."_  
_(Keith Sanders, Kona qualifier)_

_**"I am having a ton of success with your program and I really enjoy the way the plan is set up. Already, my swim time has decreased by 30s/100y and my bike time by 5min/15mi." (Alex Bruch)**_

_"Steve,_  
_I would like to thank you for the training program followed during my preparation for my first IM held in Cozumel island, sometimes up and down during this preparation but very helpfully._  
_Very happy for the achievement so I highly recommend your programs to become an IM"_ (Luis Bastar)

_**"I bought one of your training plans a short while ago and I've been really enjoying it. It's simple but varied and I can see the focus of every session. I've been doing tri for 11 years now and virtually made no improvement - I raced an Olympic distance tri yesterday and got a pb by 29 minutes! To say I am chuffed is an understatement." (Lynne Callaghan**)_

_"I just finished using your "Olympic Distance Triathlon: 'Competitors '30 week plan" and had great results - qualifying for Team USA 2015\. I would love to use your training plans throughout my off season." (Aryn Maclaren)_
